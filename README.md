# Destiny TGX Loader

Load Destiny model assets from Bungie.net with the BungieNetPlatform APIs.

## THREE.TGXLoader

The original loader that was built for [three.js](https://threejs.org/) has been moved to `/v1`.

## TGX Loader (2.0)

You can find the new loader under `v2`. It will still support outputting to [three.js](https://threejs.org/), but it will now support do a variety of other things with the model data.
